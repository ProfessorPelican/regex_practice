# regex_practice

## Overall Purpose:
This is code from me learning and practicing regular expressions based on a book I bought from Amazon.  Regular expressions have proven very useful; they are certainly worth learning.

## Personal Note:
There are far too many exclamation marks in this code.  It seems I was passionate about learning something new and useful.
